    I was confused about the search feature so i have assumed that we have to search only product details.
</p>
<p>
    So , I have added search feature in all those pages where products are like home,product and product detail page. I have done this through local storage that stores term search in home and product page and we highlight searched term in detail page through the local storage.
</p>
<p>
    And  the feature works like when i search for content in home page or product page it highlight content if exists in detail page. and we can see highlighting on that detail page by clicking the image and we will navigate to detail page. If we reload detail page highlight removes term removed from local storage.
